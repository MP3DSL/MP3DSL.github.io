<h2>Super-Pig</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>On a scale from 1-10 ten, ten being the most original, I'd say it's about a 7. It's still very abstract to me at this point.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>Like the last game, it may not be the prettiest, but it runs smooth making the gameplay very responsive</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<ul>
What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>I learned a little bit about tile mapping. I can't say I've mastered it yet, but hopefully when I iterate this game, I'll have it down</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them?
<ul>
<li>Everything you see here except from the pig was made from scratch either in ms paint or photoshop elements</li>
<li>The background music and oof sound is from YouTube</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>No code was borrowed from anywhere</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Super Pig is a race to the top of the forest</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>Pig</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>Player can use A and D keys to move left and Right, Space bar to fly up</li>
<li>Genre is Adventure</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Tile Mapping</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>Like any other developer, have fun!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>The Player can move and fly at high rated speeds, however, if they hit a platform, they fall unconscience and wake up at the beginning. The goal is to make it to the top without hitting a platform</li>
<li>Eventually, I'd like to make:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A more immersive and working map</li>
        <li>A working end goal</li>
        <li>A point and timer system</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>If they don't cheat and climb up the sides, then to have a really quick reaction time and precision movement to make it to the top</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>The character is a pig that underwent an evolution quite different from other pigs. It was given the power of flight and super speed; however, it couldn't quite master these new powers. In order to one day be a valuable asset to society, super pig, has decied to to intense training. One of which involves it flying up a trees to get to the top as fast as possible. Other than that, the story is still in development.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
<li>It's rated E for everyone, but fair warning, some may find it triggoring</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
<li>This depends on the skill level of each player. On average hopefully 1-2 minutes</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

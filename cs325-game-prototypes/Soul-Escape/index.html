<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>Idea maybe? I’m not exactly sure if there is another game with the same story/premise, but otherwise, the mechanics aren’t really new.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>The end goal is to have it playable with a controller so that it’ll have a more platformer feel.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<ul>
What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>So far, spawning and camera mechanics</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them?
<ul>
<li>Coding is done by me</li>
<li>All temporary assets are done by me, but all current and future assets such as the hero, demons, background, etc are done by my friend Kasey Walko</li>
<li>Music is Hyouhaku (Main Menu music) and Kokuten (Level music)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>I don’t know what Castlevania’s prototype looked like, but that’s the style I’m aiming for, and what I hope the prototype to be.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Soul Escape is a 2D Adventure game where you fight your way through hell to stop demons from taking over the world of the living.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>N/A</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>Put Something Here</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Put Somethin Here</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>Of course fun, but also an immersive experience into the story</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>The player will be able to free roam levels individually to look for useful items, easter eggs, etc, while being able to combo/string moves together to take down opponents. The future goal is to be able to have enough variety of mechanics that the game will keep its new feeling throughout the game. Whether that be implementing a leveling/skill tree system to unlock knew combos, and/or mix and match equipped skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>Button mashing is always a strategy for most people, but to really enjoy the experience would be to learn the combos and paying attention to the story as it may lead to other alternate endings</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>The majority of the game will be set in Hell where you start out being just an ordinary guy/girl that knows how fight a bit, but realize you must do whatever it takes in order to save the overworld from being taken over by demons. At first, demons will come back to fight you; however, eventually you’ll learn how to kill them for good. As you fight to the end, you come across many different tiers of demons such as Archdemons where the fight may take longer or prove more challenging. Eventually, you may even have to take on the Devil himself, but that depends on how the story is played out. Two alternate endings so far is to lock yourself in hell to keep the demons from ever invading again, or returning to the overworld and continue the fight there while looking for a solution to stop the demons from coming back.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tanks</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>Most games you are shooting directly at your opponent; however, in this game, you have to predict where your opponent will be to hit them.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>Like the last game, it may not be the prettiest, but it runs smooth making the gameplay very responsive</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<ul>
What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>Figuring out what all I could do with the bullets. At first I wanted them to bounce off the walls, but getting everything I wanted into one package just wasn't working, so I had to make sacrifices</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them?
<ul>
<li>Everything you see here was made from scratch either in ms paint or photoshop elements</li>
<li>Everything you hear is from Sound Bible and was edited in Sony Vegas Pro 14</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>No code was borrowed from anywhere, but the inspiration came from flappy bird as far as trying to make a game that tests your reaction time in the most triggering way possible</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Tanks is a Top Down Shooter</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>None were used</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>Player 1: WASD is used to controll the tank and using Q, E, and F controls the cannon</li>
<li>Player 2: IJKL is used to controll the tank and using U, O, and J controls the cannon</li>
<li>Genre is Top Down Shooter</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Angles, Rotation, Weapoons/Bullets, Collision, and Multiplay Mechanics</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>Obviously have fun, but to also learn to make the most of your time and try to predict your opponent</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>Players can move and shoot bullets at each other. Moving and rotation is handled based on what keys are down, and the bullets fire based on where the cannon is located, and the angle it is facing. Bullets are also able to collide with eachother! Eventually, I'd like to make a bigger map with obsticles, potentially add a ricochet system, add a health/bullet damage system, weapon types, and make the bullets fire from the ends of the barrels of the tank guns.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>Continuous movement and predictability is key!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>The characters are tanks, that just don't like each other so they are trying to kill each other. As of now, the story is kind of abstract, but hopefully a theme and storyline can be added at a later date</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
<li>Since it is a shooter, I guess we'll have to limit the game to Teens and older, but I doubt that will stop the children since they still play Call of Duty</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
<li>This depends on the skill level of each player. On average hopefully 1-2 minutes, but in the future I plan on adding a time limit so that the game does not take longer than 5 minutes to play</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

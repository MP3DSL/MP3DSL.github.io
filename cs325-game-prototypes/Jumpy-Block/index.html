<h2>Jumpy Block</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>This game tests your reaction time in a very different way compared to most games</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>The game may look very dull, but it can run on any potato you throw its way while still maintaining high frame rates!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
<ul>
What did you learn from this prototype? What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>I learned alot about the limitations, pros, and cons between arcade physics and p2 physics.</li>
<li>The easiest part in making this prototype was definitely creating the simple object sprites; however, the hardest part about making this prototype was figuring out the limitations between each physic system, and which one would best suite this game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them?
<ul>
<li>Everything you see here was made from scratch either in ms paint or photoshop elements</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>No code was borrowed from anywhere, but the inspiration came from flappy bird as far as trying to make a game that tests your reaction time in the most triggering way possible</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Jumpy Block is the is the 2019 Flappy Bird!</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
<ul>
<li>None were used</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>The only input is space bar for jumping, and the randomness lies in the unpredictability of where the block will jump next and how fast it will move to the next location!
As far as Genre goes, definitely more Arcade kinda game.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Timers and Physics</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>Players may get triggered, but the goal is to instill in them the will to never give up and to sharpen their reaction time to it's fullest potential</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<ul>
<li>Players are randomly assigned a shape as their block for the game instance and can press the "spacebar" key to jump. Each jump has it's own random velocity and gravity values making each jump unique and harder to predict the landing. The name of the game is to make as many consecutive controlled jumps possible in order to score more points. Every time the player makes a mistake or leave the charcter on the ground for too long, the score will reset to 0, but fret not as your highest score reached for that instance is recorded until you refresh the game page.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>Never taking your finger off of the space bar key unless you want a challenge.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>Well...The game world itself was designed to be simplistic in order to maximize time on figuring out how phaser and it's physics work. Besides, I like to praise myself as a better programmer than artist :P The player itself may not be the same everytime you come back which may make the challenge harder depending on who you are. Other than that, the game is pretty abstract and is what it is.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
<li>Well I'm not trying to make kids (or even adults for that matter) cry, but that didn't stop flappy bird did it? The game was made for all ages to enjoy</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<ul>
<li>At minimum, less than a second. If you're really good, then potentially days</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
